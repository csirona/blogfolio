Additionally, practicing some object-oriented programming is always a good idea. I really enjoy writing code in Python, however occasionally a request in Python takes too long, thus it might be better to use Javascript for HTTP requests. This project consists of classes (trainer, Pokemon, move, and item) each with its own attributes. These properties are set using information from the PokeAPI. Although there is still no interface, the aim is to use the PokeAPI's pictures and other features.",
